### Answer Set Equivalence

Answer set equivalence (which asserts two programs have the same answer sets) is a special case of external equivalence.
A user guide without placeholders, assumptions or input declarations, that contains every predicate in a pair of programs `(Π1, Π2)` as an output declaration, can be used to validate the answer set equivalence of `Π1` and `Π2`.
