## The mini-gringo Dialect
The [mini-gringo](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1471068420000344) dialect is a subset of the language supported by the answer set solver [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/).
It has been extensively studied within the ASP literature as a theoretical language whose semantics can be formally defined via transformations into first-order theories interpreted under the semantics of here-and-there (with arithmetic).

A mini-gringo program consists of three types of rules: choice, basic, and constraint:

```
    {H} :- B1, ..., Bn.
     H  :- B1, ..., Bn.
        :- B1, ..., Bn.
```

where H is an atom and each Bi is a singly, doubly, or non-negated atom or comparison.


## The Target Language
The formula representation language (often called the "target" of ASP-to-FOL transformations) is a many-sorted first-order language.
Specifically, all terms occurring in a mini-gringo program belong to the language's supersort, `general` (abbreviated `g`).
It contains two special terms, `#inf` and `#sup`, representing the minimum and maximum elements in the total order on general terms.
Numerals (which have a one-to-one correspondence with integers) are a subsort of this sort, they belong to a sort referred to as `integer` (abbreviated `i`).
All other general terms are symbolic constants, they belong to the `symbol` sort (abbreviated `s`).

Variables ranging over these sorts are written as `name$sort`, where `name` is a capital word and `sort` is one of the sorts defined above.
Certain abbreviations are permitted; the following are examples of valid variables:

```
    V$general, V$g, V
    X$integer, X$i, X$
    Var$symbol, Var$s
```

These lines represent equivalent ways of writing a general variable named `V`, an integer variable named `X`, and a symbol variable named `Var`.



## The Formula Representation Transformation (tau*)

The transformation referred to in the literature as `tau*` (`τ*`) is a collection of transformations from mini-gringo programs into the syntax of first-order logic, taking special consideration for the fact that while an ASP term can have 0, 1, or many values, a first-order term can have only one.
In the presence of arithmetic terms or intervals, such as `1/0` or `0..9`, this introduces translational complexities.
Interested readers should refer [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1471068420000344) for details.

The tau* transformation is fundamental to Anthem.
For a mini-gringo program `Π`, the HTA (here-and-there with arithmetic) models of the formula representation `τ*Π` correspond to the stable models of `Π`.
Furthermore, additional transformations can, in certain cases, produce formula representations within the same language whose classical models capture the behavior of `Π`.

Access the `τ*` transformation via the `translate` command, e.g.
```
    anthem translate program.lp --with tau-star
```

## Transformations Within the Target Language

The following transformations translate theories (typically) obtained from applying the `τ*` transformation to a mini-gringo program `Π` into theories whose classical models coincide with the stable models of `Π`.

#### Gamma
The gamma (`γ`) transformation ([introduced](https://doi.org/10.1017/S147106840999010X) by Pearce for propositional programs) and extended to first-order programs as [Heuer's Procedure](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43619-2_18) was implemented in an unpublished Anthem prototype in ??.
The implementation of this system follows the description found [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43619-2_18).
For a predicate `p`, a new predicate representing satisfaction in the "here" world named `hp` is introduced.
Similarly, predicate `tp` represents satisfaction of `p` in the "there" world.
Thus, for a theory
```
    forall X ( exists I$ (X = I$ and 3 < I$ < 5) -> p(X) ).
```
`gamma` produces
```
    forall X ((exists I$i (X = I$i and 3 < I$i < 5) -> hp(X)) and (exists I$i (X = I$i and 3 < I$i < 5) -> tp(X))).
```
Access the `gamma` transformation via the `translate` command, e.g.
```
    anthem translate theory.spec --with gamma
```
or stack it with the `τ*` command, e.g.
```
    anthem translate program.lp --with tau-star,gamma
```


#### Completion

This is an implementation of an [extension](https://doi.org/10.1017/S147106842300039X) of [Clark's Completion](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-3384-5_11).
It accepts a completable theory (such as those produced by `τ*`) and produces the (first-order) completion.
For example, the completion of the theory
```
    forall X ( X = 1 -> p(X) ).
    forall X Y ( q(X,Y) -> p(X) ).
```
is
```
    forall X ( p(X) <-> X = 1 or exists Y q(X,Y) ).
```

Access the `completion` transformation via the `translate` command, e.g.
```
    anthem translate theory.spec --with completion
```
or stack it with the `τ*` command, e.g.
```
    anthem translate program.lp --with tau-star,completion
```
However, keep in mind that the original program must be tight for the models of the completion to coincide with the stable models of the program!
