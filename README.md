# anthem

`anthem` is a command line application for translating answer set programs in the mini-gringo dialect of [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) to first-order theories.
Using an automated theorem prover, these theories can then be used to verify properties of the original programs, such as strong and external equivalence.

Check out the [Manual](https://potassco.org/anthem/) to learn how to install and use `anthem`.

If you want to use `anthem` as a library to build your own application, you can do so.
Check out the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/anthem/) for the available functionalities.
