# anthem

`anthem` is a command-line application for assisting in the verification of answer set programs.
It operates by translating answer set programs written in the mini-gringo dialect of [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) into many-sorted first-order theories.
Using automated theorem provers, `anthem` can then verify properties of the original programs, such as strong and external equivalence.

Check out the [Manual](https://potassco.org/anthem/) to learn how to install and use `anthem`.

If you want to use `anthem` as a library to build your own application, you can do so.
Check out the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/anthem/) for the available functionalities.

## Where's anthem 1?

Until recently, you would have found Patrick LÃ¼hne's version 1 of `anthem` here, which was discontinued and therefore moved to [anthem-1](https://github.com/potassco/anthem-1).
You are currently looking at version 2, which is the latest version and the only one that is actively developed.
This version is a complete reimplementation of the original system with significantly extended capabilities.
It was started by Zach Hansen and Tobias Stolzmann, but is now being developed by a growing [group of people](CONTRIBUTORS.md).
We'd like to thank Patrick for the effort he put into his implementation and the kindness of resolving the naming conflict with us.
